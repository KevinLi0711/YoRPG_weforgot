## New Protagonists
* Ninja: Press button to instakill. Weaknesses: everything (it has paper defenses)
* Barbarian: Tanky but low strength and attack. Special attack comes with a very high multiplier to compensate.
* Gambler: If you win the 50/50, you deal lots of damage. Otherwise, very little damage
## New Monsters
* Firebender: Deals burn damage that ignores defense. Burn damage increases over time. High defense and low attack
* Werewolf: Pray you don't get unlucky because this thing has a high attack, and can crit for double damage
* Golem: Low attack and high defense, but it deals more damage the more you hit it
