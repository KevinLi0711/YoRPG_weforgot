Disco: 
  - I got this error when trying to reference the instance vars, error: <identifier> expected
  - We can only change the instance variables from superclasses in a method, unless those instance variables are modified with protected
  - super must be the first method in constructor
  - super can take the place of variables that would otherwise be unnecessarily repeated
  - cannot reference _name before supertype constructor has been called
      - When creating a subclass for protagonist, there was this error because the subclass required a name parameter
  - if you call super(), and the constructor being reference also uses super(), then it kinda chains and goes further up
  - If you try using if statements in a try statement, you get the error: exception IOException is never thrown in body of corresponding try statement
      - But calling a method that uses if statements doesn't return this error

QCC: 
  - Do we get graded on game balance
  - Why do if statements not work in a try statement?
